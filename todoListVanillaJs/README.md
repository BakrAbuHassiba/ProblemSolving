# ðŸ“Œ Task: TaskManagerApp

## ðŸ§  Description

This JavaScript project implements a **simple task management system**. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks using a visually styled list built entirely with vanilla JS and the DOM API.

## ðŸš€ Main Features

- `Add Task`  
  âž¤ Adds a new task to the list if the input is not empty.

- `âœ” Done Button`  
  âž¤ Marks the task as `"done"` and updates the background and text color accordingly.

- `âœ– Delete Button`  
  âž¤ Removes the selected task from the list.

- `displayTasks()`  
  âž¤ Dynamically updates the DOM to reflect the current state of all tasks in the array.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Structure

The task list is stored in an array called `tasks`, where each task is an object:

```js
{ name: "Task name", status: "pending" | "done" }
