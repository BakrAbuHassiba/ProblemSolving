# Box Animator with jQuery

## Description
This project demonstrates how to use **jQuery's `.animate()`** method to create a chained animation sequence on a DOM element.  
The `.box` element moves around the screen in a square pattern while changing size and background color at each step.

## Features
- Animates movement **horizontally and vertically**.
- Dynamically **increases and decreases** the box's size.
- Changes the **background color** after each animation step.
- Uses **callback functions** to run animations in sequence.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structure of the page.
- **CSS** – Styling for the box.
- **JavaScript** – Animation logic.
- **jQuery** – DOM selection and animation.

## How It Works
1. The red `.box` starts at the top-left corner.
2. It moves **right**, grows in size, and changes to **blue**.
3. It moves **down**, shrinks, and changes to **green**.
4. It moves **left**, grows again, and changes to **yellow**.
5. It moves **up**, shrinks, and changes back to **red**.

## How to Run
1. Save the code in an `.html` file.
2. Download and include jQuery (or use a CDN link).
3. Open the file in your browser and watch the animation.
