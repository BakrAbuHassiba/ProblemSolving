# 😊 Smiley Face Interaction & 🎞️ Video Controls

This project is a simple yet interactive HTML5/JS task combining **SVG element manipulation** and **video player controls** using pure JavaScript.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 SVG Face Interaction

- **Hover Effects on Eyes**: When you hover over either eye (`leftEye` or `rightEye`), it changes color to blue, returning to black when the mouse leaves.
- **Smile Coloring**: The mouth and sides (`mouse`, `leftMouse`, `rightMouse`) change stroke and fill color on hover to blue, reverting to black when not hovered.

### 🎥 Video Player

A built-in `<video>` element with extended functionality through custom buttons:

- ✅ `Play` button: Starts the video.
- ⏹️ `Stop` button: Pauses the video.
- 🔇 `Mute` and 🔊 `UnMute` buttons: Toggles the audio.
- 🔊 `Volume Range` slider: Controls the video’s volume dynamically.
- ⏳ `Progress Bar`: Shows real-time progress based on current playback.
