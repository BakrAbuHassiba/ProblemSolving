# 🚀 JavaScript Tasks Collection

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript problems and mini-projects organized into separate folders. Each folder includes a single self-contained task with its corresponding HTML, CSS, JS (and a README where necessary). The purpose is to practice and demonstrate various JavaScript concepts such as:

- DOM manipulation
- Events and UI interactions
- Data structures (like linked lists)
- Functions, conditionals, and loops
- Error handling and validation
- Styling with JavaScript
