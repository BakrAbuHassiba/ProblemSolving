# üìö JavaScript Practice Tasks ‚Äì Basic to Intermediate

This repository contains 12 JavaScript tasks that cover fundamental concepts such as object manipulation, array operations, sorting, merging, date handling, and user interaction via prompts.

Each problem is designed to reinforce your understanding of JavaScript through practical examples.

## üìù Tasks Overview

### 1. **Car Info Display**
- Define a car object with properties `brand`, `model`, and `year`.
- Create a function to print its values using string concatenation.

### 2. **Loop Through Object**
- Use a `for...in` loop to iterate through object keys.
- Print both keys and their corresponding values.

### 3. **Swap Object Keys and Values**
- Create a new object with keys and values swapped from the original.
- Note: Does not handle duplicate values in the original.

### 4. **Nested Object Access**
- Define a `person` object with nested `address` and `job` objects.
- Print specific fields (like `city`, `country`, `job title`, and `salary`).

### 5. **Sort People by Age**
- Sort an array of person objects by their `age` in ascending order using `Array.prototype.sort`.

### 6. **Find Max and Min in an Array**
- Manually loop through an array to find its maximum and minimum values.
- Uses basic `for` loops and comparisons.

### 7. **Reverse an Array**
- Create a new array by manually reversing an existing one using a backward `for` loop.

### 8. **Apply Discount to Products**
- Loop through an array of product objects and apply a 10% discount to each.
- Adds a new `discountedPrice` field to each object.

### 9. **Get Day from Date**
- Input: A date string in `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format.
- Output: The name of the day (e.g., "Friday").

### 10. **Merge and Deduplicate Two Arrays**
- Prompt the user to enter two arrays of numbers.
- Merge the arrays, remove duplicates, and display the final array.

### 11. **Phone Book (Add, Search, Exit)**
- Create a phone book app with `add`, `search`, and `exit` operations.
- Uses prompt for dynamic user interaction.
- Stores contacts as objects in an array.

### 12. **Merge Two Objects (Handle Duplicates)**
- Merge two objects.
- If duplicate keys exist, rename the key from the second object by adding `_1`.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Understand basic object and array manipulation.
- Practice using loops, conditions, and functions.
- Get comfortable with JavaScript's native methods like `sort()`, `concat()`, `includes()`, and `assign()`.
- Work with user inputs via `prompt()`.
