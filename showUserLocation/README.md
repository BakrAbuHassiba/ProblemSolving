#Show User Location

This mini-project demonstrates how to access the user's current geographic location using the **Geolocation API** in JavaScript and display it in **Google Maps**.

## 🔍 Features

- Button to trigger location fetch.
- Uses the browser's geolocation feature.
- Opens the current location in a new Google Maps tab.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 📸 Preview

A button is presented to the user. When clicked, it fetches the user's latitude and longitude, and opens the corresponding location on Google Maps.

## ⚠️ Notes

- The browser will ask for location permission.
- This works only on secure origins (`https://`) and may not function in some local environments without HTTPS.

## 🧪 How to Run

Just open `index.html` in a browser and click **Show my location**.
